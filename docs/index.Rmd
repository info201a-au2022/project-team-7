## Dynamic Paragraph

The data we have compiled includes the average statistics for each artist on Spotify. These statistics are as follows: `r artist_info()`. The categories we focused on were danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, duration_ms, and popularity. Furthermore, we averaged the statistics for all songs on Spotify. The statistics we calculated were: `r summary_info`

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!!
